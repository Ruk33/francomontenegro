summary:    "Linux Mint, Mate"
---

I've recently decided to jump from [ElementaryOS](https://elementary.io/es/) to [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/) using the
Mate desktop and let me tell you, it's great to be back with a consistent
and simple design that makes sense (at least to me).

## Theme

The theme I'm using is called [Gray-95](https://www.mate-look.org/p/2065177/), with the window border WinMe (this one
comes already pre-installed with the desktop, yay!)

The icon set is called [Buuf For Many Desktops](https://www.mate-look.org/p/1012233).

## How to install all of this stuff?

It's easy, just go to your HOME folder, and create the folder `.icons` and `.themes`. If you
are using Linux Mint with Mate, these folders are already created. Keep in mind that since
these folders begin with a `.` they are hidden. To show these folders, click View > Show Hidden
Files (Ctrl + H).

Just extract the folders of the theme and the icon and that's it. In Settings (Control Center) > Appereance, 
you should be able to see the new themes.

## Font antialising

If you want to go the extra mile, go to Settings > Appereance > Fonts tab and select Monochrome. Ah... perfect!
