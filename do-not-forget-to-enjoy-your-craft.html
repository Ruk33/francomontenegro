<h2>Do not forget to enjoy your craft</h2>
<p>When was the last time you enjoyed what you do? I mean, I'm talking about development, software, applications, the stuff that needs to get done for yesterday; the stuff that can't take what it SHOULD take; the stuff that you can't clean up and refactor because a new feature is coming upright in the next corner. I'm talking about your craft. When was the last time you enjoyed it?</p>

<h3>This is just a reminder</h3>
<p>We live in rushing times. Everyone is rush to do everything and, it's pretty easy to get caught up in this shit. It's pretty easy to wake up hating what you do because you know you are delivering below your quality to make up for the crazy deadlines. I know, you can't take forever either to deliver otherwise you wouldn't be building anything. But then again, having to deliver entire features, pages, applications in a matter of weeks or even days? Shit got out of control. That's why software development sucks and why it's full of bugs.</p>

<h3>You gotta be productive, man!</h3>
<p>And the trend continues, it seems like today, every framework, every library, every tool is focused on that, "productivity" Are you productive? here, check this out, build a crap application in a matter of minutes and then continue to give the illusion that software is that easy and can be shipped in this little time. Enjoying what you do? What are you talking about? There is no time for that! PRODUCTIVITY IS KING.</p>

<h3>Enjoy the little things</h3>
<p>So as I said, this is just a reminder (or maybe a rant... yeah, rant may be appropriate too). Remember to take a few minutes from your busy day to enjoy what you do.</p>
