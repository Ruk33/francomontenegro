<h2>The perfect Linux box</h2>

I've recently decided to jump from ElementaryOS to Linux Mint using the
Mate desktop and let me tell you, it's great to be back with a consistent
and simple design that makes sense (at least to me).

<h3>Theme</h3>

<p>The theme I'm using is called Gray-95 (https://www.mate-look.org/p/2065177/), with the window border WinMe (this one comes already pre-installed with the desktop, yay!)</p>

<p>The icon set is called Buuf For Many Desktops (https://www.mate-look.org/p/1012233).</p>

<h3>How to install all of this stuff?</h3>

<p>It's easy, just go to your HOME folder, and create the folder `.icons` and `.themes`. If you are using Linux Mint with Mate, these folders are already created. Keep in mind that since these folders begin with a `.` they are hidden. To show these folders, click View > Show Hidden Files (Ctrl + H).</p>

<p>Just extract the folders of the theme and the icon and that's it. In Settings (Control Center) > Appearance, you should be able to see the new themes.</p>

<h3>Font antialising</h3>
<p>If you want to go the extra mile, go to Settings > Appearance > Fonts tab and select Monochrome. Ah... perfect!</p>
