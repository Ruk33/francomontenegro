<h2>Creating a server emulator in C for Lineage 2</h2>
<p>For those of you who do not know it, Lineage 2 (https://lineage.com) is a MMORPG Korean game who was quite successful in the 2004-2006. I was so hocked up with it that I even began researching how to create my own server for it using L2J (https://l2jserver.com/) (an amazing project in Java that emulates a server), back then when I was ~14. I believe it was actually the game that brought me into programming.</p>

<p>Nowadays the game is still online but remains a vague shadow of what once was, I mean, it got to a point where even the game itself has a built in bot to play the game... do I have to say more?</p>

<section>
<h3>Building a server emulator in C</h3>
<p>So why C? Well, it's one of those languages that I really like but sadly, I don't find projects to work with it, until now. Keep in mind I'm very new to the language, so if you are an expert with it, you may cringe a bit.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Setting the goals</h3>
<p>The goal was quite simple, when you open up the game, the first thing you see is the login screen. My objective was to:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Being able to stablish a connection with the client</li>
    <li>Being able to send basic packets</li>
    <li>Being able to get and decrypt packets from the client</li>
    <li>Send a "password incorrect" every time the user tries to log in</li>
</ol>

<p>Quite simple, right?</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3>A two year project</h3>
<p>And then I began. Just to put you in context, I didn't even know how to deal with dependencies/libraries on C. At the very beginning I began looking for package managers, you know, like NodeJS (https://nodejs.org/en/) uses NPM (https://www.npmjs.com/), but in C, it seems like these tools are not a common thing. So ok, I will install those "manually", what about the Lineage 2 documentation?</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Thank the god lord for the internet and the documentation</h3>
<p>Lineage 2 uses a protocol to communicate between client and server, and luckily, the internet was full (http://l2jserver.com/) of (http://fursoffers.narod.ru/Packets.htm) documentation (https://code.google.com/archive/p/l2adenalib/wikis/L2LoginServerProtocol.wiki). I didn't quite understood the whole picture yet but at least it was something.</p>

<p>So ok, I kinda knew there was a protocol, there was the packets, each packet was composed of the size of the packet, the header (telling you what type of packet it was) and the content. I also knew that these packets were encrypted using Blowfish (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowfish_(cipher)) and also, there was a bit of [RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)) in the mix, cool!</p>

<h3>Let's go back to the basics, sockets</h3>
<p>The first version I coded was for Windows (https://github.com/Ruk33/l2auth/tree/976070794384964681e5caaaab6bcd1d0ee62a49), and boy, let me tell you it was painful. I don't know if it was because I'm a newbie but the documentation was quite painful, compared to Linux that is. Nonetheless, I was able to get a socket running and listening for connections. Time to test it and... the whole thing hang up. Nice.</p>

<p>This one, I believe, was the hardest part of the whole project because on every test/try, the whole thing hang up and I didn't knew what was wrong, nor the client told me. So it was just a matter of changing stuff and try again, multiple times until I got it, the packet was coming, the client didn't hang up. Now, it was a matter of decrypting the packet.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3>OpenSSL</h3>
<p>For this project, I wanted to do the most from scratch, but I know cryptography is one of those things where you simply need to use a library or it's quite probably you will get it wrong, kinda like dealing with dates.</p>

<p>Looking for cryptography libraries wasn't hard. I knew I needed something that supported RSA and Blowfish and OpenSSL (https://www.openssl.org/) did that and much more, plus it seems to be the standard for these type of things, so it was quite safe to pick it up. I also looked at Sodium (https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/), and I really liked it but sadly, they don't support Blowfish, and with reason, the algorithm is quite old and deprecated for newer ones.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Playing around and trying to decrypt packages</h3>
<p>Again, similar to the previous issue with the client hanging up, I found cryptography quite similar, you try it, you see it doesn't work, and you try again. There is nothing telling you "hey, you may wanna look into this".</p>

<p>So I spent quite a bit of time on this one, I review the code multiple times, I even scratch it and began all over again but nothing, I wasn't able to decrypt the packet. I read the documentation from OpenSSL, I checked the Lineage 2 documentation and nothing. Everything seemed to be right, and then, I saw it... endianness (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness). Oh my f*cking lord, but oh well, a new concept to learn because I wasn't even aware this was even a thing.</p>

<p>We are back into the game, I reviewed the documentation and found a mismatch, Lineage 2 deals with little endian while OpenSSL deals with big endian. Now I only needed a way to convert it:</p>
<pre>
<code>
#include <assert.h>

unsigned int decode32le(const void* src)
{
        assert(src);
        const unsigned char* buf = src;
        return (unsigned int) buf[0] | ((unsigned int) buf[1] << 8)
                | ((unsigned int) buf[2] << 16) | ((unsigned int) buf[3] << 24);
}

unsigned int decode32be(const void* src)
{
        assert(src);
        const unsigned char* buf = src;
        return (unsigned int) buf[3] | ((unsigned int) buf[2] << 8)
                | ((unsigned int) buf[1] << 16) | ((unsigned int) buf[0] << 24);
}

void encode32le(void* dst, unsigned int val)
{
        assert(dst);
        unsigned char* buf = dst;
        buf[0] = (unsigned char) val;
        buf[1] = (unsigned char) (val >> 8);
        buf[2] = (unsigned char) (val >> 16);
        buf[3] = (unsigned char) (val >> 24);
}

void encode32be(void* dst, unsigned int val)
{
        assert(dst);
        unsigned char* buf = dst;
        buf[3] = (unsigned char) val;
        buf[2] = (unsigned char) (val >> 8);
        buf[1] = (unsigned char) (val >> 16);
        buf[0] = (unsigned char) (val >> 24);
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>Not the prettiest, maybe and quite possibly not the best but functional. Time to test it again and... there was it, my login credentials printed on the terminal.</p>

<p>Now, I can read from the client, great! What about answering back?</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Answering back, coming up soon</h3>
<p>I will leave this section for a second part, but I can tell you, the project is so fun and exciting, that not only I was able to answering and sending packets back to the client, I went way further into the goals and now, I'm able to log into the game and play it.</p>

<p>You can find the source code of this project on GitHub (https://github.com/Ruk33/l2auth). I have included support for [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to make the installation easier. You are more than welcome to contribute if you would like to.</p>
